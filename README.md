# React Hooks Project

Welcome to the React Hooks Project repository! This collection of projects is designed to provide comprehensive examples and demonstrations of various React hooks. Each project focuses on a specific hook, showcasing its implementation, use cases, and best practices.

## Motivation

React hooks have revolutionized the way developers manage state and side effects in functional components. This repository aims to help developers of all levels understand and master React hooks through practical examples and real-world scenarios. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer seeking advanced usage, you'll find valuable insights in each project.

## Folder Structure

Explore the projects organized by different hooks:

1. **useState**
   - *Latest Commit*: [Commit Link](link-to-commit)
   - Description: The `useState` project demonstrates the basic usage of the `useState` hook for managing component-level state in functional components. It includes examples of simple state updates, conditional rendering based on state, and managing form input.

2. **useEffect**
   - *Latest Commit*: [Commit Link](link-to-commit)
   - Description: The `useEffect` project showcases the implementation and usage of the `useEffect` hook for handling side effects in functional components. It includes examples of fetching data from an API, updating state based on component lifecycle events, and cleaning up side effects.

3. **useRef**
   - *Latest Commit*: [Commit Link](link-to-commit)
   - Description: The `useRef` project is marked as "Done" and contains examples and use cases for the `useRef` hook. It demonstrates how `useRef` can be used to persist values across renders and access the DOM directly.

4. **useContext**
   - *Latest Commit*: [Commit Link](link-to-commit)
   - Description: The `useContext` project explores the usage of the `useContext` hook for managing global state in React applications. It includes examples of creating and consuming a context provider, allowing components to share state without prop drilling.

5. **useReducer**
   - *Latest Commit*: [Commit Link](link-to-commit)
   - Description: The `useReducer` project focuses on the `useReducer` hook, demonstrating state management using a reducer function. It includes examples of complex state logic, dispatching actions, and handling state transitions in a predictable way.
